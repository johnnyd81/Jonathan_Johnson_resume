          <p id="p1">
            An avid reader, devoted family man and eternally optimistic are some things people have described me as. I'm
            a
            Johannesburg native born on the 24 of March 1981. My upbringing instilled values that focused heavily on
            hard work, perserverance, humility and consistency. Physical activity also plays a vital role in my life
            which allowed
            me to be a successful athlete, footballer and tennis-player. My natural competitiveness always makes me
            demand
            the best from myself in whatever scenario I find myself in.
          </p>
          <p id="p2">
            To me the setting and accomplishment of a goal is very important. It is one of my greatest motivations in
            life to complete
            a task and exceed expectations. To take every development process of a task and to refine it to the point
            where
            I as an individual am being
            shaped as well. Music also forms a big part of my life since both my parents are able to play musical
            instruments.
            It adds another layer of perspective to my life that brings creativity and the unexpected since every
            musician expresses
            music differently.
          </p>
          <p id="p3">
            I'm always inspired by people who make the impossible seem like the everyday. It drives me as an individual
            to see beyond the
            expected and strive for the unexpected. I'm a strong believer in what you put in is what you get out and as
            such many of my
            decisions have been guided by that mindset. It's what keeps me continuously striving to make the most of
            every moment and make life
            just that little bit easier for the people I come into contact with.

          <p id="p4">My early schooling saw me excelling at Mathematics, English, Science and Geography. It was also
            here that
            my lifelong love for reading was
            developed. My dedication and commitment was so much that I finished primary school third overall in my final
            year. In high school my interest shifted more towards the computer science field that was still quite
            new. When I graduated from high school
            I enrolled in an A+ computer hardware course that was seen as the foundation for my later software
            education. At the time acquiring employment in
            the technology field was not easy so I did a technical course and acquired a certificate in Motor Trade.
            This allowed me to use my skills to work for myself
            and at the same time continue studying part-time.

          <p id="p5"> My initial experience with regard to work was working with close family friends in their small
            start up
            businesses eg. Installation of
            built-in furniture, selling household appliances. My first formal job was at a cable installation company
            called Interconnect Systems. This
            job exposed me to the Information Technology field on a daily basis as I was laying the cables that the
            computers were using to operate. I also
            had first hand experience of watching how each computer would be connected in the network by way of the main
            computer room. It ignited the desire
            to delve deeper into the Information Technology sector. I then started working for myself using my previous
            Motor trade knowledge. While doing this
            I also assisted at a shoe start up business called North West factory store. This experience exposed me to a
            leadership role
            that gave me the opportunity to develop my decision-making and negotiation skills in a fast paced business
            environment.

        The projects I have created thus far have all been apps. These include a calculator, a currency converter and an
        online shopping app. The code for the
        online shopping app can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/johnnyd81/gitTask2.git">here.</a> This app acts as
        a real life online store that takes a user's order, calculates the
        price which includes VAT and gives
        the user further options like discount coupons and delivery methods. It acts as a fully functional website that
        includes a catalogue page, shopping
        cart that displays the products you selected and my index page that also acts as my landing page. The coding
        languages used were HTML, CSS, javaScript
        and jquery. I also created a webpage that allows a user to store information for music tracks. The webpage
        allows the user to edit as well
        as delete the tracks entered. The code can be found <a
